            <p>
              Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Jerry</strong>, a Software Engineer based in{" "}
              Brisbane, Australia, who's specializing in AI and Cloud
              Technology. I thrive on facing challenges and relish the sense of
              achievement that comes from solving complex problems. In June
              2024, I graduated from the{" "}
              <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/" className="uq">
                University of Queensland{" "}
              </a>
              with a Master's degree in Information Technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work experience includes developing web applications, creating
              AI solutions, deploying apps on the cloud, and conducting AI
              experiments.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about leveraging technology to make a positive
              impact and am always eager to learn and adapt to new advancements
              in the field. I value collaboration and believe that teamwork and
              open communication are key to driving innovation.

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>
            As a Software Engineer at The University of Queensland, I developed
            a web-based questionnaire application to help parents monitor and
            assess their children's behaviors. I focused on creating engaging
            user interfaces and enhancing user experience through result
            visualization and features like PDF generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time as a Software Engineer Intern at Desygner, I
            integrated AI capabilities into their design platform. By utilising
            OpenAI's function calling feature and LlamaIndex, I enabled users to
            interact with an AI agent to operate platform functionalities
            seamlessly. This experience provided me with practical exposure to
            working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in a production
            environment.
